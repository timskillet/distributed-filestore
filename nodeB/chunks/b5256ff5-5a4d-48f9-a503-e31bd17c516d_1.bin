y Cloud Map to discover available nodes.

Pros:

Managed service; handles dynamic IPs.

Supports health checks, so you only discover live nodes.

Cons:

Slight learning curve.

API usage is free at low scale, but Cloud Map may have minimal costs if you scale.

b. Auto Scaling Groups + Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
What it is: If your storage nodes can handle requests via a load balancer, you can attach an internal ALB/NLB and let clients use that as the discovery endpoint.

Pros: No need to manage node lists yourself.

Cons: Works best for stateless or client-agnostic storage access; less ideal for direct peer-to-peer node communication.

2. DNS-Based Service Discovery
a. Route 53 Private Hosted Zone
Terraform can create a private hosted zone and register nodes’ private IPs as A records as they spin up.

Dynamic registration options:

Each node runs a startup script to register its IP using aws route53 change-resource-record-sets.

Or use Terraform null_resource with local-exec to register nodes after creatio
