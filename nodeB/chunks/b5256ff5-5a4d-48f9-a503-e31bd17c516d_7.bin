; strong consistency isn’t strictly needed for most filestore scenarios.

If you want fully managed AWS-native discovery, Cloud Map is the closest alternative but involves some setup and minor costs.

💡 Bottom line:
Your approach is perfectly valid for a distributed filestore. It’s essentially a DIY service registry using DynamoDB, which is common for small-to-medium clusters. For large-scale or enterprise-grade systems, you might switch to Cloud Map later for managed discovery.

If you want, I can draft a concrete DynamoDB schema + node registration pattern optimized for filestore nodes that includes TTL/heartbeat handling. It would be production-ready and fully dynamic. Do you want me to do that?

How would you implement the DynamoDB service discovery? Would storage nodes just make entries to this table and the API server retrieves them?

Yes, that’s the core idea—but let’s make it concrete and production-ready. You can think of the DynamoDB table as your service registr
