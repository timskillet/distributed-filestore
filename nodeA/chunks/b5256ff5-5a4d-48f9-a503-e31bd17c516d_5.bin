 DynamoDB table. For example:

NodeID	PrivateIP	Port	Timestamp/TTL
node-1	10.0.1.12	8080	2025-11-13T12:00
The node periodically updates a heartbeat timestamp or TTL so that dead nodes can be detected.

API servers query the table to discover available nodes dynamically.

Optionally, nodes clean up their entry on shutdown (but TTL can handle crash cases).

Pros:

Works across VPCs, regions, and availability zones.

Fully dynamic; nodes can come and go.

Free/low-cost at small scale (pay-per-request for DynamoDB is minimal).

No external dependencies.

Cons:

You’re implementing your own “registry + heartbeat” logic.

Slightly more operational complexity (handling TTLs, stale entries, race conditions).

Latency for discovery is limited by DynamoDB read consistency and heartbeat frequency.

2. AWS-Managed Alternatives
AWS has built-in mechanisms that could reduce custom code:
