No external tools like Consul required.

If you want, I can sketch a Terraform + startup script pattern that automatically registers nodes in Route53 or DynamoDB, so your filestore nodes discover each other at runtime without any human intervention. It’s a fully automated pattern used in production.

Do you want me to do that?

Is this a custom solution or should I rely on using AWS resources for service discovery?

My idea:
Implement a service discovery mechanism using DynamoDB where storage nodes register themselves on startup, and the API server queries DynamoDB to discover available nodes dynamically.

Your idea of using DynamoDB for service discovery is a valid and practical approach—but it’s more of a custom solution rather than relying on AWS’s built-in service discovery mechanisms like Cloud Map or Route 53 Private Hosted Zones. Let’s break it down carefully:

1. Custom DynamoDB Service Discovery
How it would work:

Each storage node, on startup, writes an entry into a
