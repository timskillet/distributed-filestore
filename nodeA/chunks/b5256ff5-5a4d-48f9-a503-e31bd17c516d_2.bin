Pros: Free if you stay in the private zone; DNS is native to most applications.

Cons: Needs scripting to dynamically update records.

b. mDNS / Consul-style Approach
For smaller clusters (less than ~50 nodes), you could use multicast DNS (mDNS) or a lightweight Consul agent.

Nodes broadcast themselves, and others discover them automatically.

Pros: Free and simple for small clusters.

Cons: Doesn’t scale well over VPC subnets or multiple AZs; more of a “DIY” approach.

3. Client Pull from an Instance Metadata Source
If your nodes are in AWS Auto Scaling Groups, you can:

Tag nodes with a known key, e.g., Role=StorageNode.

Clients use the AWS SDK to query EC2 instances by tag within the same VPC.

This is a completely free approach because it uses native EC2 APIs.

Pros: No extra service; dynamic discovery works across node lifecycle.

Cons: Clients need AWS credentials/permissions; can get tricky if cross-AZ discovery is needed.

4. Hybrid / Lightweight Approaches
Shared S3 file: Each node writes
