 dynamic, scales	Minimal cost if many nodes; learning curve
Route 53 Private Hosted Zone	Nodes update DNS records with private IPs	Simple DNS-based discovery; no code needed for clients	Requires dynamic DNS updates (startup scripts)
ELB/NLB	Nodes behind a load balancer; clients access LB DNS	Fully managed, simple for client requests	Only works if you can access nodes via LB; not ideal for direct node-to-node communication
Observation:
Using DynamoDB is more flexible than ELB (especially for peer-to-peer storage nodes), but less “hands-off” than Cloud Map or Route 53.

3. Recommendation
If your storage nodes need direct peer-to-peer discovery rather than just being accessed via a load balancer:

DynamoDB registry is a good approach, especially if you want low cost and full control.

Make sure to implement:

Heartbeat updates (for node liveness)

TTL for stale entries

Atomic writes or conditional updates if multiple nodes register simultaneously

Use the DynamoDB API with eventual consistency for discovery
